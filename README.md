ðŸ’» Week 1 of February: Push !



Still in the first week of February, and Iâ€™m already feeling inspired as I deploy my backend application to the internet using RENDER! ðŸš€

Deployment is often the final yet crucial step in bringing a project to life. This week, I focused on optimizing my backend for deployment while ensuring smooth communication with the frontend.



Hereâ€™s what I covered:



âœ… Same Origin Policy & CORS â€“ Understanding how browsers restrict cross-origin requests for security reasons and how to configure CORS middleware in Express to allow controlled access.

âœ… Frontend Production Build â€“ Learning how to bundle and optimize my frontend application (React/Vue/Angular) for production, reducing file size and improving performance.

âœ… Serving Static Files from the Backend â€“ Configuring Express to serve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files efficiently 

âœ… Streamlining Deployment of the Frontend â€“ Hosting my frontend on a CDN (Content Delivery Network) like Vercel or Netlify, while pointing API calls to my deployed backend on Render.

âœ… Proxy Configuration â€“ Avoiding CORS issues in development by setting up a proxy in my frontend



Deploying to Render was a game-changer, making deployment simpler and more efficient without complex server configurations. Now, my backend is live, and the frontend seamlessly communicates with it! ðŸŽ‰



Are you also working on deployment this month? Letâ€™s connect and share experiences!
